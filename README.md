## Table exercise in React
This is a basic table app in React. App gets data from json-file
and displays a table of them. 

You can:
- Add a new row to the table
- Delete rows
- Modify rows

## Starting 
 
In the project directory:
- first run `npm install` 

- then run `npm start` to start the app

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## About this app
This was my first ever app made with React and it was interesting 
to implement. As a guide, I used React documentation (https://reactjs.org/) 
and also tutorial "Create a Table in React" from Youtube 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYjdzpZv5yc).
